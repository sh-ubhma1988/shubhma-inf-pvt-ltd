        THE MISSING GOAT
    </h1>


    <p>it had started one lazy sunday afternoon for a small town near toronto in Canada.
        <br>
        Two school going friends decided to play a prank and had a funny idea
        <br>
        they picked up three goats from a neighbourhood and the painted the numbers 1,2 & 4.
        <br>
        that night they let the goats loose inside thier school premises.
        the next morning when the authories wre seemed to be worried, where are goat number 3.
        <br>
        they spent the whole day searching for goat number 3.
        <br>
        as the goats they found hadf number 1,2 & 4 painted on their sides.
        <br>
        they assumed that their will be goat number 3 with number 3 painted on its side which they were not able to locate in the school.
        <br>
        the svhool decleared  classes for the students for the rest of the day.
        <br>
        the teachers,helpers, guards,canteen staff and all other school employees were busy looking for the goat number three.
        <br>
        can you guess why ?
